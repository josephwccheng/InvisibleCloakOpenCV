# Invisible Cloak OpenCV

Learning about different image processing methods using OpenCV, including the concept of **Masking**, and Morphological Transformation

**Morphological Transformation** - basic operations on image shape

 - Erosion - erodes away boundaries of foreground object (will only consider 1 if all surrounding are 1)
 - Dilation - if any pixel contains 1 everything is 1
 - Opening - erosion followed by dilation - useful in removing noise
 - Closing - dilation followed by erosion - closing small holes inside the foreground
